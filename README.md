<h1>Steve Browning Code Examples</h1>

<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>
Most my work over the last 6 years I am not able to show as the WordPress plugins and theme / API code is currently in Postmedia production and is private.

The small number of WordPress parts I'm able to show are these in this code examples.</p>

<h2>JavasScript</h2>
<p>The Plugable Native JS Modules was a demo I did for our Senior DevOps / Monetization group to show how the ads and vendor scripts could be plugged into the front-end. I also wanted to learn Native Modules. This was done over a weekend.</p>

<h2>Elasticsearch Tools</h2>
<p>The Elastisearch Tools are a set of Node.js scripts that I wrote to help the DevOps get our Elasticsearch server mapped, indexed and allow for posts to be deleted.</p>
