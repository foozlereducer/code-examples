        "content": "<div id=\"1\"> <p>Embraer SA, the world’s biggest regional-jet maker, got an order for 15 E-Jets valued at $677 million for Japan Airlines Co., which also agreed to buy 32 planes from Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp.</p> <p>The first deliveries of E170 and E190 planes are expected next year, Embraer said in a statement today. JAL has an option to buy 12 more of the regional jets, which would increase the value to more than $1 billion based on list prices.</p> <p>The sale will help shore up Embraer’s production of its current E-Jets as the Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil-based company prepares to build its next-generation planes starting in 2018. Embraer is betting on a refreshed version of its 15-year-old regional-jet family as the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. unit joins the competition with Japan’s first passenger jet.</p> <p>“This repeat order by Japan Airlines is an affirmation of the added value that E-Jets have brought to its operations over the years,” Paulo Cesar Silva, chief executive officer of Embraer’s commercial aviation unit, said in the statement. “It has enabled the airline to grow its domestic network in a sustainable way.”</p> <p>The 15-plane firm order will double the number of Embraer planes in JAL’s fleet. The Tokyo-based carrier added the company’s aircraft to its fleet in 2007.</p> <p>Embraer rose 0.5 percent to 21.89 reais at 11:13 a.m. in Sao Paulo.</p> <p>The JAL agreement with Mitsubishi Aircraft is the unit’s third this year for planes the manufacturer expects to start delivering in 2017 after test flights next year. Mitsubishi Aircraft, which has delayed air trials for its jet three times, is challenging Embraer and has set a goal of winning half the global regional-aircraft market during the next 20 years.</p> <p>The JAL order brings Mitsubishi Aircraft’s total to 400, Hideo Egawa, the planemaker’s chief executive officer, told reporters in Tokyo.</p> <p>“Our sales force is very active in Europe, Southeast Asia and North America,” Egawa said. “We expect more orders as well from Latin America and Africa.”</p> <p>The list price for the Mitsubishi planes is 4.7 billion yen ($45 million) each, bringing the agreed order’s value to about 150 billion yen, Japan Airlines President Yoshiharu Ueki told reporters in Tokyo.</p> </div>",

Continuing in this direction will not serve the public interest nor help to prevent such an incident from happening again,â lawyers Thomas Walsh and Marc-Antoine Cloutier said Thursday.</p> <p>Harding, Labrie and a third MMA employee, railway-operations manager Jean DemÃ¢itre, have been charged with 47 counts of criminal negligence causing death. MMA has also been charged with the same counts.</p> <p>Forty-seven people died in July 2013 when a runaway crude oil train derailed in Lac-MÃ©gantic, setting fire to the downtown core and spilling millions of litres of oil into the environment.</p> </div>",

        "content": "<div id=\"1\"> <p>MONTREAL – Scott Abramovitch and Lonny Dubrofsky first met two decades back, working, respectively, as a Montreal Expos bat boy and producer of the radio broadcasts of the teamâs games.</p> <p>The guys hooked up again seven years ago in L.A. to form a production company, perhaps appropriately called Breaking Balls Films. So it might stand to reason that their first major Hollywood production, The Calling (opening Friday), would be a horror story focusing on the tragic demise of the Expos from Montreal.</p> <p>Not quite. The Calling is a horror story, but in lieu of bats and balls, there are knives and guns and all manner of occurrences most foul. The Calling, starring Oscar winners Susan Sarandon and Ellen Burstyn, is a psychological thriller about the hunt for a serial killer with a Messiah complex at loose in the boonies of this country.</p> <p>Abramovitch and Dubrofsky produced the film, while the former bat boy also penned the screenplay, based on the novel of the same name by Inger Ash Wolfe.</p> <p>Abramovitch began his Expos stint in 1991 and dutifully picked up errant bats until 1998. âBut I realized by the time I had reached puberty, that wasnât going to be a career,â muses Abramovitch, 38, holding court in his parentsâ Hampstead home with Dubrofsky.</p> <p>For his part, Dubrofsky was up in the broadcast booth, working with legendary play-by-play caller Dave Van Horne. He conducted post-game player interviews and also produced Mitch Melnickâs show on what was then CIQC. âThose were truly wonderful days here,â Dubrofsky, 36, reminisces.</p> <p>In light of their roots, their film foray, delving deeply into Christian mysticism, is all the more surprising.</p> <p>âI just happened to stumble upon a positive review of the book,â Abramovitch says. âThen after reading it, I fell in love with it and bought the film rights to it. After 50 pages, I felt this was a movie that we should be making: a commercial project set in Canada and written by a Canadian.â</p> <p>And, yes, howâs this for a refreshing twist: Canada plays Canada. Though much of The Calling is shot in rural Ontario, action also takes place in B.C. and Quebec. And all impressively done on a rather paltry budget of $4.5 million.</p> <p>The subject of Christian mysticism was, clearly, novel to the guys. âSo we figured we could rely on the wisdom of director Jason Stone, but it turned out that he was Jewish like us,â Abramovitch reveals.</p> <p>âSo when ever we hit on complex issues while researching the script, we figured we could certainly rely on the wisdom of the author. But Inger Ash Wolfe was actually a pseudonym for the novelist Michael Redhill, who was also Jewish. So here we had all these Jewish guys working on a film dealing with Christian mysticism. Thank God we had Susan Sarandon, a Catholic very passionate and knowledgeable about religion.â</p> <p>Prior to launching Breaking Balls Films, Abramovitch, a lawyer who graduated Cum Laude from Boston College law school, worked as a staff writer on the Lion King prequel Tinkerbell and scripted Sleeping Beauty II: Once Upon a Dream, both for the Walt Disney Company. Among other script credits, he co-wrote the feature No Surrender, starring Mena Suvari, and penned and produced the TV pilot Prayer Hour, a satire of televangelists with Jason Priestley.</p> <p>Dubrofsky, who collaborated with Abramovitch on Prayer Hour, first made his mark producing the acclaimed feature film Die Mommie Die, which made its debut at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and received a jury award there. Dubrofsky also has TV production credits on ER, Gideonâs Crossing and the live telethon America: A Tribute to Heroes.</p> </div>",

        "content": "<div id=\"2\"> <p>âWe decided we could work well as a team in our own production company,â Dubrofsky says. âScott had a couple of book properties he had in mind. We optioned and developed a few of them as screenplays, with The Calling being the first feature film project.â</p> <p>The film opens today in 20 select markets in Canada and the U.S., before being released wide throughout the continent next Friday. A solid story helps, but the star-power of a Sarandon â who plays the central character, a burnt-out police inspector â as well as that of Burstyn, Donald Sutherland and Gil Bellows, can go a long toward propelling a motion picture, too.</p> <p>âWe got such a great group of talent together, but we really lucked out with (Sarandon),â Dubrofsky says. âHer agent saw the script and said it would be great for her. And when she came on board, it was, literally, a snowball effect with all the other talent signing up. Who doesnât want to work with her?â</p> <p>Apart from Sarandon, the actor who really stands out is Christopher Heyerdahl, of Nikita and Twilight Saga fame. He plays the spooky Simon, the man with the Jesus complex.</p> <p>âOur greatest stroke of luck was casting him,â Abramovitch notes. âWe had someone else in mind for the role, someone who everyone loved, but we had to lose him because this was a Canadian production and we were limited to the number of Americans we could use.</p> <p>âSo there we were two weeks before shooting and we didnât have that role cast yet. One of the actors told us about Christopher. So I rushed down with a camera to audition him in Toronto, and two seconds into the audition, it was clear this guy was perfect.â</p> <p>Abramovitch and Dubrofskyâs next film collaboration has them on more familiar terrain. Alive and Kicking, based on a true story and to be shot in Montreal in October, is about a group of women, soccer moms, who previously had no involvement in sports but who decide to form their own team.</p> <p>âThey begin playing other womenâs teams who have been together for years and they initially get in way over their heads,â Abramovitch says. âIt has a certain Bad News Bears quality.â</p> <p>So when can we expect the definitive tale about the demise of the Expos?</p> <p>âWhat we have more in mind is a film about the resurrection of the Expos,â Dubrofsky is quick to respond.</p> <p>âYeah, I know, another movie about resurrection,â Abramovitch cracks. âBut I was in town last spring for the reunion at the Big O with the Mets and Blue Jays, and the support I saw from the city was just incredible.</p> </div>",

And that magic has remained with me ever since.â</p> <p>The Expos also served as an icebreaker in landing Sutherland for the part of the priest, much learned in Christian mysticism. Sutherland is also much learned in Expos lore, a mega-fan who took in as many home games as he could.</p> <p>âAnd if he couldnât make the games, he would call in, anywhere from his place in the Eastern Townships to wherever he happened to be working throughout the world, to have someone in the Expos office place the phone next to the radio or in the broadcast booth next to (Van Horne), and he would listen to the entire game,â Abramovitch points out. âNow thatâs some kind of dedication, not to mention one hell of a long-distance bill.â</p> <p>bbrownstein@montrealgazette.comTwitter: billbrownstein</p> </div>",

This has the townâs lead police inspector, Hazel Micallef (Susan Sarandon), jumping to some macabre conclusions. But given the fact that the jaded Hazel has been known to overindulge in drink and prescription drugs, few take her seriously â at first.<br> Old-school, cynical cop though Hazel may be â she doesnât even know how to work her cellphone â she is one dogged investigator. With the help of fellow cops Greene (Gil Bellows) and Wingate (Topher Grace), she is able to determine that a series of similarly unexplained crimes, targeting unlikely victims, has taken place across the country. Having consulted an aged priest (Donald Sutherland), she is convinced that there is a serial killer with a Messiah complex roaming the countryside.<br> Natch, her superiors believe Hazel has had one too many nips of hooch. So does her mom (Ellen Burstyn), with whom Hazel lives. But when a creepy-looking stranger (Christopher Heyerdahl) is spotted lurking in the community and when more dead bodies are discovered, folks start taking Hazel a little more seriously.<br> Even crusty Greene, who has no religious convictions, finds a change of heart as a result of these bizarre murders: âThe only god I ever prayed to before was Guy Lafleur.â<br> Without revealing events that transpire, the film should have viewers on the edge of their seats â not to mention having them avoid seemingly bucolic towns in the Canadian bush.<br> In somewhat of a departure, and adding to her already diverse array of roles, Sarandon is entirely credible as the beleaguered yet committed cop. As is Sutherland as the weary yet wise man of the cloth. But itâs Heyerdahl â looking the part of a mad escapee from the Ingmar Bergman stable of religious zealots â who will scare the bejesus out of viewers with his calm, demonic demeanour.<br> And how about a hand for Canada not playing Pittsburgh or Paris, but simply Canada? And so well at that.<br>  </p> </div>",

But Richmond Hill&rsquo;s downtown, while intensifying, intends to retain its village-like character even though a few condominiums have quietly sprouted in the area, creating a work-in-progress skyline. According to Dave Barrow, mayor of Richmond Hill, the city grows two to three per cent annually, adding 3 to 4,000 new residents, which translates to about 1,000 units of new housing each year. But intensification cannot function without transit, he says. &lt;strong&gt;NO LAYOUT &ndash; IMAGE TEST:&lt;/strong&gt;",

During the island's San Juan festival, held each year on June 23 and 24, Minorcan race horses gallop and prance on their hind legs through the streets of Ciutadella to honor of the town's patron saint. As the \"caixers\" (horse riders) ride together in a parade, spectators attempt to pat the horses' chests to get good luck.

The judge concluded that the jury could assess McClinticâs demeanour in videotaped police statements. He also took into account that the defence could cross-examine her, the Crown argues.</p> <p>âThe trial judge gave a fair and balanced charge and provided the jury with all the requisite tools to properly assess McClinticâs testimony without highlighting the confirmatory evidence,â the lawyers say.</p> <p>âIn the context of this trial it was impossible for the jury to not have been aware of McClinticâs credibility problems. The trial judge properly exercised his discretion and committed no error.â</p> <p>Rafferty did not testify at trial, but argues in his appeal that he was âat mostâ an accessory after the fact to murder â a concept the judge did not put to the jury.</p> <p>His actions proven by evidence other than McClinticâs testimony, such as cleaning the scene, destroying evidence and giving a false alibi, are âequally consistent with being an accessory,â Calarco writes.</p> <p>The trial judge told the jury that Raffertyâs post-offence conduct canât help them in determining which offences he committed, and was right not to specify that they could also conclude he was an accessory.</p> <p>âThe appellant did not testify nor is there any logical reason to explain why the appellant, an innocent dupe according to the defence theory at trial, would assist McClintic in covering up this horrific crime,â the Crown writes.</p> <p>âIt is not the function of the trial judge to invite the jury to speculate and provide instructions which were not requested and which find no support in the record.â</p> <p>McClintic told court a horrifying story of a drug-addled couple abducting a young girl at random for the manâs sexual pleasure, then killing her with inconceivable brutality. She claimed Rafferty was directing her every step of the way, ordering her to snatch a young girl for him, making her buy a hammer and garbage bags then getting her to help him clean up at the murder scene.</p> <p>The Crown at trial argued it didnât matter whether McClintic or Rafferty physically killed Tori â he was guilty because they acted together.</p> </div>",

CATHARINES, Ont. â Chances are you have never heard of Sam Oosterhoff.</p> <p>But the 19-year-old social conservative and Brock University political science student has become a key figure in Ontario provincial politics.</p> <p>On Saturday, Oosterhoff won the race to become the Ontario Progressive Conservative candidate for Niagara West-Glanbrook, the territory of former PC party leader Tim Hudak.</p> <div class=\"embed\"></div> <p>Oosterhoff will contend for the seat against Liberal Vicky Ringuette and New Democrat Michael Thomas in the Nov. 17 by-election, regarded as another mini-referendum on the deeply unpopular government of Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne and leadership of PC boss Patrick Brown.</p> <p>Should he win, Oosterhoff would become the youngest MPP in Ontario history.</p> <div id=\"fsk_splitbox_1715\" class=\" fsk_splitbox_1715\"></div> <p>But party insiders say his victory over two established Tory politicians â including former St. Catharines Conservative MP and current PC party president Rick Dykstra â is simultaneously a rebuke of the PC party establishment in the riding and the result of vote-splitting and internal political manoeuvring gone awry.</p> <p>âI think part of the lesson here is that if we, as the party establishment, take things for granted, if you take people and groups in the community for granted, they will stand up and make their voice heard. That is what happened here,â said Grimsby regional councillor Tony Quirk who, along with Dykstra, was regarded as one of the favourites to win the nomination.</p> <p>âLook at what is happening to the Republican Party. Look at the lessons they have had to learn in the last few months.â</p> <p>Oosterhoff is not saying what he thinks of his victory, the state of his party or what he thinks it all means. At least not on Sunday.</p> <blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>Look at what is happening to the Republican Party. Look at the lessons they have had to learn in the last few months</p></blockquote> <p>âHe is here, but he doesnât work on a Sunday as he believes it is a day of rest,â said a man who answered Oosterhoffâs phone Sunday morning. He did not identify himself and hung up when a request to interview Oosterhoff was repeated.</p> <p>However, on a video posted on his campaignâs Facebook page Saturday night, Oosterhoff said he was âhumbled.â</p> <p>âI ran to be a strong conservative voice, with conservative values and principles,â Oosterhoff said in the video. âNow that I am the candidate, the next big task is to keep this riding blue in the by-election.â</p> <p>The nomination was decided using a multi-choice vote. Voters selected their first, second, third and fourth choices. If there was no winner after the first-place choices were counted, the second choices were counted and so on.</p> <p>Oosterhoff shocked many Tories with a clear victory. He won 699 votes to Dykstraâs 525. Mike Williscraft, owner of the local newspaper NewsNow, received 245 votes and Quirk got 225.</p> <p>Dykstra, who congratulated Oosterhoff after the votes were counted, declined an interview request Sunday.</p> <p>Quirk said although he and Dykstra were widely regarded as the frontrunners, the view from his campaign was somewhat different.</p> <p>âI told anyone who would listen that Oosterhoff was a serious contender,â he said. âSam had a great deal of support in the riding. Just his family alone gave him a 100-vote advantage.â</p> <p>Quirk said he ran his nomination campaign while attending to his duties as a regional councillor and working his full-time job. Oosterhoff, he said, had a lot more time to gather supporters.</p> <p>âBasically he reduced his class load (at Brock) so he could work on his campaign full time. And he did a great job,â Quirk said. âAnd, to be honest, I was caught with my pants down a little bit.â</p> <p>Quirk also reportedly attempted his own manoeuvring, which backfired.</p> <p>A source inside the Dykstra campaign, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Quirk, in a bid to block Dykstra, asked his supporters to write in Oosterhoff as their second choice. In return, Quirk asked to be the second choice of Oosterhoffâs supporters.</p> <p>However, the source said, many of Oosterhoffâs supporters did not select Quirk as their second choice.</p> <p>Quirk said Sunday that he and Oosterhoff did indeed have an agreement of mutual support. However, Quirk said he underestimated the number of people backing Oosterhoff.</p> <p>At the same time, Williscraft won enough support away from Quirk and Dykstra to allow Oosterhoff to gain an advantage, Quirk said.</p> <p>Williscraft, however, said while many of his supporters selected Oosterhoff as their second choice, blunting Dykstraâs effort, he doesnât think his candidacy a made a definitive difference.</p> <blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>A nomination is one thing, but a by-election or general election is something else</p></blockquote> <p>âThere were just too many variables in play,â Williscraft said, noting the late change in the voting date left the candidates scrambling. âAnd you have to give credit to Sam. He was all in, knocking on doors and talking to people everywhere.â</p> <p>Some Niagara Tory party members, speaking anonymously, said they are concerned Oosterhoffâs socially conservative views do not line up with those of PC leader Patrick Brown. Some said they may not vote on Nov. 17 as a silent protest.</p> <p>Williscraft said Oosterhoffâs views served him well in the nomination campaign but may be a hindrance in the by-election.</p> <p>âCertainly the views of his church played a significant role in getting the support he did, but I donât know how well that fits with the views and goals of the PC Party as a whole,â Williscraft said. âA nomination is one thing, but a by-election or general election is something else and he is going to have to adapt to that.â</p> <p>Quirk, meanwhile, doesnât see Oosterhoffâs views as a problem.</p> <p>âI have said from the beginning that I will support the party and support the candidate that wins the nomination,â said Quirk.</p> </div> </div> </div>",

        "content": "<div id=\"page1\"> <p>WASHINGTON – The skyline shimmers, the music pulses and Donald Trump’s helicopter swoops in for a landing.</p> <p>Oozing authority, the billionaire strides purposefully â in slow-motion, for added impact â toward some important matter of business in “New York is my city,” as Trump calls it.</p> <p>Week by week, year by year, 14 seasons of “The Apprentice” or “Celebrity Apprentice” served as a grand homage to all things Trump, running from 2002 to 2014.</p> <p>Donald Trump the actor made Donald Trump the businessman seem pretty fabulous. Americans never saw what was taking place behind the scenes.</p> <p>The show offered Trump the ultimate opportunity for product placement: Contestants fawned over Trump’s gilded-to-excess Fifth Avenue apartment, his casinos, golf courses, even his girlfriend and later wife Melania. They promoted his modeling company, his water bottles and other Trump-branded businesses, as the man himself spun out bits of business advice known as “Donaldisms” and bemoaned the daunting task of telling eager young dreamers, “You’re fired.”</p> <div id=\"fsk_splitbox_1715\" class=\" fsk_splitbox_1715\"></div> <p>This picture of Trump as smart, decisive, blunt, benevolent, rich â really rich â and never wrong turned out to be the ideal launching pad for his improbable presidential campaign.</p> <p>That it didn’t always jibe with reality didn’t seem to matter to the millions of Americans who turned “The Apprentice” into a national phenomenon. Or to NBC, which reveled in the show’s sky-high ratings early on, and kept tinkering with the formula in an effort to revive them in later years.</p> <p>It turns out that the unseen side of “The Apprentice” was darker : Show insiders have told the AP that in his years as a reality TV boss, Trump repeatedly demeaned women with sexist language, rating female contestants by the size of their breasts and talking about which ones he’d like to have sex with.</p> <p>And one former contestant, Summer Zervos, said Friday that Trump made unwanted sexual advances toward her in 2007 when she met with him at a Beverly Hills hotel to talk about a potential job. Zervos, who had competed on the show in 2006, said Trump became sexually aggressive during their meeting at the hotel, kissing her open-mouthed and touching her breasts.</p> <p>Speculation about what kind of Trump conduct might be lurking in video out-takes from the show has swirled in recent days, since the release of “Access Hollywood” footage showing Trump joking about grabbing women by the genitals and kissing them without asking. But the owners of the “Apprentice” production company say they cannot legally release footage from the show.</p> <p>Trump’s boorish behaviour toward women wasn’t apparent to viewers of the reality TV show.</p> <p>And for all of the snickering about the silliness of reality TV, pop culture expert Robert Thompson says, the show was “very, very important to shaping, framing and establishing the person of Donald Trump who would then go on to become the GOP nominee.”</p> <p>“If ‘The Apprentice’ had never happened, I don’t think Donald Trump would be where he is right now politically,” says Thompson.</p> <p>Trump already had an outsized reputation when he launched “The Apprentice” in January 2004. By that point, the businessman with a knack for self-promotion had already soared high, fallen from grace, become something of a punchline and was back on the rebound, more focused on licensing his name than building things. He’d eagerly done any number of cameos in movies and TV shows to promote himself as a titan of business.</p> </div>",

        "content": "<div id=\"page2\"> <p>“My name’s Donald Trump and I’m the largest real estate developer in New York,” Trump declared as he launched Season 1, Episode 1 of “The Apprentice” with trademark immodesty. “I’ve mastered the art of the deal and I’ve turned the name Trump into the highest quality brand. As the master, I want to pass along my knowledge to somebody else.”</p> <p>That was a fact-check-worthy way to start things off, and Trump’s hometown newspaper, The New York Times, obliged by pointing out that while the audacious star of “The Apprentice” might have had the highest profile among the city’s developers, plenty of others were doing more and bigger deals.</p> <p>Trump had been approached with reality TV proposals before, but nothing clicked until “Survivor” producer Mark Burnett came to him with the idea of a show set in the “urban jungle” of New York.</p> <p>The original idea was to have a different business executive serve as host every season, with Trump the first, says Jeff Gaspin, head of program strategy at NBC Entertainment in 2001-2002 and later chairman of NBC Entertainment.</p> <p>“His role was originally fairly small â introduce the challenge then appear in a brief boardroom scene,” Gaspin said in an interview. “Donald turned out to be a natural and really loved being on camera. The boardroom scenes were expanded to almost one-third of the show.”</p> <p>People gravitated to Trump’s persona as a tough, decisive and irreverent boss who offered “at least the illusion of a pathway to success,” says Yale’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an associate dean who wrote public critiques of the show for newspapers. He got to know Trump after the businessman called to complain about the academic’s harsh reviews of Trump’s on-air business practices.</p> <p>To many Americans, says Sonnenfeld, Trump represented the “embodiment of the American dream,” harking back to the “Daddy Warbucks” imagery of decades past.</p> <p>It made for good TV â never mind the reality that Trump got ahead with inherited money, that his casinos were headed for more bankruptcies, that his deals often weren’t as lucrative as he’d suggested or that his projects left behind a trail of contractors saddled with unpaid bills. Beyond of all of that, there are the new revelations about Trump’s vulgar comments about women contestants and crew members, and Zervos’ allegations that Trump made sexual advances toward her.</p> <p>Trump himself initially seemed almost gob-smacked by how quickly the show took off.</p> <p>“I go into the boardroom, I rant and rave like a lunatic to these kids, and I leave and I go off and build my buildings,” Trump told CNN’s Larry King in 2004. Can you believe this?</p> <p>The line between reality and TV on the show was blurry then, and it’s still a matter of debate now.</p> <p>Trump has suggested the show was a hit because it captured the authentic Trump. At other times, though, he’s dismissed some of his insulting comments on “The Apprentice” by saying “a lot of that was entertainment.”</p> </div>",

In 2009, Trump’s casino interests went through another bankruptcy. An additional corporate bankruptcy in 2012 wiped out Trump’s remaining stake.</p> <p>As for the benevolent side of Trump showcased on “The Apprentice,” The Washington Post reported in August that in almost every instance in which Trump pledged on the show to make a personal contribution to a charity highlighted on “Celebrity Apprentice,” the donation really came from sources other than Trump.</p> <p>Eric Dezenhall, a Washington crisis management consultant, says Trump was adept at the two skills necessary to succeed on TV: “having a rap and being provocative.” His rap: “I’m a business wizard.” His provocations: unending.</p> <p>“You scream, you shout,” says Dezenhall. “The whole concept of ‘you’re fired’ is isolating your enemy. You’re identifying someone bad and exposing them. That’s exactly what this campaign is about.”</p> </div>",

The animals that evolved an outer covering of dry, horny scales are called reptiles. Their living descendants include turtles, crocodilians, lizards, snakes and birds (feathers are modified scales).</li> <li>There are more than 10,000 species of reptiles in the world. In Canada, there are 54 species and sub-species.</li> <li>This exhibition focuses on the âcold-bloodedâ reptiles, which depend on outside sources of heat to warm their bodies. (The first known warm-blooded lizard, the tegu, can heat itself to as much as 10 Â°C above its surroundings, making it unique among reptiles.)</li> <li>Although turtles are an ancient group, the structure of the shell has changed little since the age of the dinosaurs. Scientists disagree about where turtles fit in the evolutionary tree of life.</li> <li>Snakes are lizards that have lost their legs, ear openings and eyelids â possibly ancient adaptations for an underground existence.</li> <li>More people die from bee stings each year than snakebites. In the United States, about 8,000 people receive venomous snakebites. Only nine to 15 of those people die.</li> <li>Most venomous snake bites in North America are from copperheads, water moccasins and rattlesnakes.</li> <li>Alligators, crocodiles, caimans and the gharial are the closest living relatives of birds. They have birdlike hearts, digestive tracts, ear canals, and rib cages.</li> <li>Alligators and other crocodilians are the âloud mouthsâ of the reptile world. Calls vary widely depending on species, age, size and sex. Some species can communicate over 20 different kinds of messages through sound alone.</li> <li>Chameleons change skin colour to express a mood or aid in camouflage. Tentacle-like chromatophores move pigments up and down through the layers of skin. The closer the pigment gets to the surface of the skin, the darker the animal appears.</li> </ul>",

        "content": "<div> <p class=\"p1\">Whiprsnapr Brewing Co. has released a beer called âSlingrâ in partnership with hockey celebrity Garry Galley, in hopes of raising awareness and funds for mental health initiatives.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The beer, which bears the No. 22 and an angel carrying a slingshot as a memorial to Daron Richardson. In 2010, Daron, the 14-year-old daughter of Luke Richardson, who was then the assistant coach of the Ottawa Senators, took her own life after struggling with mental illness.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Slingr will be available at WhiprsnaprâsÂ brewery on Bexley Place in Bells Corners as well as in select bars starting Thursday. Five per cent of proceeds will be donated to the Do it for Daron (D.I.F.D.) charity, which the Richardson family created to help support mental health initiatives at the Royal Ottawa Hospital.</p> <p class=\"p1\">DaronÂ also played hockey, wearing No. 22, and was a player that Galley, a retiredÂ NHL player and hockey broadcaster, got to know well over the years.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Galley said that when Whiprsnapr approached him with the idea of brewing a beer together, he was thrilled. But, the idea of using the beer to help a charity that close to his heart made the initiative even better.</p> <div id=\"fsk_splitbox_1715\" class=\" fsk_splitbox_1715\"></div> <p class=\"p1\">âIf this logo gets out there and helps to create conversation and raises money to help people, this is what weâre aiming at,â said Galley.</p> <p class=\"p1\">âThe whole idea of the name Slingr is David versus Goliath. David was a slinger and Goliath was a behemoth. Mental health illness is a Goliath. Itâs taking too many peopleâs lives and its affecting too many people.â</p> <p class=\"p1\">The Ottawa-raised Galley, 52,Â met the peopleÂ from Whiprsnappr whenÂ they all attended Sir John A. MacDonald High School, which closed in 1987 and is now St. Paul Catholic High School. Theyâve been in touch over the years but it wasnât until more recently that talks ramped up about having Galley involved in the brewing process.</p> <p class=\"p1\">The idea of getting celebrities to lend a hand in the brewing process has picked up steam in the world of microbrewing over the past few years. Having a name attached to a beer brings awareness to the upstart brewer while allowing the celebrity to put hisÂ own personal stamp on an item that their fans can enjoy at home.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Slingr is an easy-drinking maple cream ale, which is what Galley, an avid fan of craft beer and micro breweries,Â wanted to create, something that can be enjoyed at any time. The beer uses maple syrup during the brewing process and is aged on maple wood chips to add a bit more flavour.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Slingr isnât a limited-time release, according to Galley. The beer will be an ongoing offering at Whiprsnappr.</p> </div>",

The family trust bought the 1,200-acre island in 1953 as its first international project. Annacis, once a former farming and fishing island in the middle of the Fraser River, became Canada&acirc;s first industrial park. The island is now fully developed as an industrial hub, but Grosvenor still owns 210 acres and nine industrial buildings covering 1.1 million square feet.",

It still owns 300 acres there, including 190 acres in Belgravia, adjacent to Buckingham Palace, the land for which was also provided by the Grosvenors. They also retain their ancestral home, the 10,800-acre Eaton Hall estate. When the Duke died on Tuesday, he was the 68th-wealthiest person in the world and the third-richest in the U.K.",

His one bit of unwanted public attention was a massive 5-million pound ($8.4-million) party his father hosted for him at Eaton Hall for his 21st birthday. His father made it clear early on that he might be extraordinarily wealthy some day, but that he had to earn his place in life. In 1993, when his son was two, the Duke said in an interview that, &acirc;He&acirc;s been born with the longest silver spoon anyone can have, but he can&acirc;t go through life sucking on it. He has to put back what he has been given.&acirc;",

Charlottetown, Moncton, St. Johnâs and Quebec City rounded out the top five âsafestâ cities, according to the survey respondents. Toronto, Montreal, Saskatoon and Edmonton were in the bottom five. Regina, Halifax, Victoria, Vancouver and Calgary were perceived to be in the middle of the pack.</p> <div class=\"column\"> <p>Compared to the <a href=\"http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-630-x/11-630-x2015001-eng.htm#def2\">Crime Severity Index, </a>which takes both the volume and the severity of crime into account, Ottawa is actually the third-safest city of the 15 on the list, after QuÃ©bec City and Toronto, said Maggi.</p> <p>A lot of the public perceptions about a cityâs relative safety are based on its media exposure, especially on a national level, he said.</p> <p>âWhen people read about Ottawa, itâs not about crime. Itâs about the prime minister or politics.â</p> <p>But some cities got an unfair bad rap in the survey. Winnipeg, for example, was ranked as the most dangerous city in Canada by the respondents â 35 per cent said it was safe or very safe, compared with 56 per cent who said it was unsafe, while the remainder were unsure. But according to the Crime Severity Index, Winnipeg is safer than a number of other cities, including Vancouver, Edmonton, Regina and Saskatoon.</p> </div> <p>Perceptions of Toronto were also distorted. Almost half of the respondents believed Toronto is unsafe â it was ranked as the second-most dangerous city in the list of 15 cities by the respondentsâ reckoning. But according to <a href=\"http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/160720/t003a-eng.htm\">Statistics Canadaâs 2105 Crime Severity Index</a>, Toronto is one of the safest cities in Canada.</p> <p>Big-city crime tends to attract both the intensity of media coverage â because these cities have more media outlets â and also the length of coverage, which might include interviews with the victims and their families, and coverage of any resultant trial.Â  In fact, respondents in the Atlantic provinces, where there isnât the same media presence, were the most likely to say they were âunsureâ when asked what they thought about the safety of the 15 cities on the list, said Maggi.Â  A cityâs reputation for danger can also hang on for decades longer than the reality warrants.</p> <p>âPeople always believe that where they live is safe. By comparison, other places always seem a little bit worse,â he said.</p> </div> </div>",

The U.S. Olympic Committee confirmed swirling reports Sunday.<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-rio-summer-olympics/u-s-swimmer-ryan-lochte-robbed-gunpoint-brazil-n630396?cid=sm_tw\">Lochte confirmed it himself</a> in an interview with NBC News.</p> <p>âWe got pulled over, in the taxi, and these guys came out with a badge, a police badge, no lights, no nothing just a police badge and they pulled us over,â <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-rio-summer-olympics/u-s-swimmer-ryan-lochte-robbed-gunpoint-brazil-n630396?cid=sm_tw\">Lochte said to the network</a>. âThey pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground â they got down on the ground. I refused, I was like we didnât do anything wrong, so â Iâm not getting down on the ground.</p> <p>âAnd then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, âGet down,â and I put my hands up, I was like âwhatever.â He took our money, he took my wallet â he left my cell phone, he left my credentials.â</p> <p>Along with Lochte, Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen were in a taxi that was stopped and held up, USOC spokesperson Patrick Sandusky said. All four athletes are safe.</p> <div id=\"fsk_splitbox_9\" class=\" fsk_splitbox_9\"></div> <p>Brazilian swimmer Thiago Pereiraâs representative told The Post earlier on Sunday that Lochte was in a taxi leaving Club France on the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon when the vehicle was robbed. <a href=\"http://oglobo.globo.com/esportes/medalhista-olimpico-tem-arma-apontada-para-ele-apos-deixar-festa-diz-fox-news-19920003\" target=\"_blank\">Video on O Globo</a> shows Lochte and Pereira at what appears to be a rave.</p> <p>FlÃ¡vio Perez said the incident, in which Lochte was unharmed, occurred after a birthday celebration at a Brazilian club.</p> <p>âThiago Pereira and his wife Gabriela Pauletti were in Club France, the French house in Brazil, and they were celebrating the birthday of a friend in common,â said Perez, Pereiraâs spokesman.</p> <p>âLochte was also in the same place, commemorating the same birthday. Ryan and Thiago are friends. Thiago and his wife left earlier, they left alone, the two of them. Thiago and his wife went back to their hotel. Then Thiago, on finding out what happened, called Ryan. Ryan is well, and Thiago said that the robbery, according to Ryan, was in the taxi. The taxi was robbed.â</p> <div class=\"npImgCentre\"> <div class=\"npPosRel\"> <p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1181302\" src=\"http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/08/149444526.jpg?w=620&amp;quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;h=413\" alt=\"Al Bello / Getty Images\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\"></p> <div class=\"npPhotoTxt npTxtPlain npTxtLeft\"> <div class=\"npGroup\">\n<span class=\"npPhotoCredit\">Al Bello / Getty Images</span><span class=\"npPhotoCaption\">Pereira (left) and Lochte in a 2012 file photo from the London Olympics.</span>\n</div> </div> </div> </div> <p>A spokesman for Club France, Hugo Sppezapria, said that Lochte, Pereira and friends attended a party inside Club France â a large establishment along the lagoon with sports fields, a place to ride horses, and food and clothing vendors â into the early morning hours Sunday. The party, which began around 11:30 p.m., took place at a venue inside the club called the Picadeiro Armando de Alencar and was hosted by CafÃ© de la Musique. Some 2,500 people attended.</p> <p>Sppezapria said that Lochte and Pereira left the party together between 2:30 and 3 a.m. and visited another âcommunity.â</p> <p>âWhy the hell would they do that?â Sppezapria said.</p> <p>Sppezapria said he didnât know where the alleged robbery took place.</p> <p>Brazilian police issued the following statement Sunday afternoon: âThe Civil Police were not notified about the robbery which an American swimmer suffered after leaving a party. The institution is investigating the incident, on the base of information circulated by the press. The American Consulate was contacted and said it had not been notified either. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said that the US Committee denied the crime. The investigation is in progress.â</p> <blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>Ryan is well, and Thiago said that the robbery, according to Ryan, was in the taxi. The taxi was robbed</p></blockquote> <p>Reports of the incident conflicted Sunday morning. Mark Adams, the IOCâs director of communications, told reporters in Rio that the report is ânot true,â but Lochteâs mother confirmed it <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/rio-2016/2016/08/14/olympic-swimmer-ryan-lochte-held-up-gunpoint-rio/88715436/\" target=\"_blank\">for USA Today</a>.</p> <p>âI think theyâre all shaken up. There were a few of them,â Ileana Lochte said. âNo, they were just, they just took their wallets and basically that was it.â</p> <p>David Marsh, Lochteâs personal coach and the head womenâs coach for the U.S. swim team, also texted USA Today to deny the report. Finally, Lochte himself confirmed the report to NBC.</p> <p>Fox Sports News in Australia initially quoted Lochteâs mother describing the encounter as âterrifyingâ and she said she was en route to meet him. Lochte reportedly had been invited to a party by Pereira and was accompanied by three teammates. Foxâs Ben Way reported that Lochte was ârobbed of his wallet.â</p> <p>Earlier, another Rio Olympics spokesman said he had heard there âwas an issueâ involving Lochte but could not confirm the details.</p> <p>Lochte, 32, is a six-time Olympic gold medalist. He and the U.S. team won gold in the 4Ã200-metre freestyle. Lochte has not been in an event since Thursday and swimming events ended Saturday night.</p> <p><em>With files from National Post Staff</em></p> </div> </div>",

        "content": "<div> <p class=\"printable-text\">Not yet 6 months old, a once-battered and beaten Dinah Paige Whited lay motionless in a Georgia hospital bed, where her parents â accused in the abuse that put her there â were allowed to say their last goodbyes before their baby girl took her last breath.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Her father, Justin Whited, is charged with aggravated battery for an April 23 beating that left her small body full of broken bones and a bleeding brain, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Her mother, Jamie, is charged with cruelty to children for failing to stop him.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Both were granted permission to see her Monday morning before doctors in Atlanta removed “Baby Dinah” from the machine that had been keeping her alive.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Neither of the parents’ attorneys were immediately available for comment.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Friends and family members said the couple, who had been together since their teen years, struggled with drug abuse and domestic issues, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Jamie Whited’s mother told the newspaper that her daughter had been in legal trouble for possession of methamphetamine and, police said, Jamie later admitted that she was on prescription painkillers the day her child nearly stopped breathing on her own.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Her mother said Justin Whited, who also allegedly abused drugs, was angry and controlling â once taking a swing at his wife and putting his fist through a wall.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Justin’s mother disputed the accusations.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Indeed, from the outside, neighbours said they seemed a happy family of three. “They seemed like good people,” Mary Strong, a neighbour, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last month. “I didn’t see them argue.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">In April, Dinah’s maternal grandmother, Paige Carson-Barrett, posted a photo on Facebook showing the then-nearly 2-month-old.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“Look who is all dressed up and ready to go shopping,” Carson-Barrett wrote about the baby girl, who was wearing a soft, pink hat and blue floral dress. “Dinah Paige is spending the weekend with her Gammy.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Just a week later, her young life was coming to an end.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">The morning of April 23, Justin Whited dialed 911.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">He told police that when he woke up, his daughter was wailing and gasping for air, according to court documents cited by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Her lips turned blue and, eventually, she went quiet.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Police pulled up to the home in Monroe, near Atlanta.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“As I was talking with Justin and Jamie Whited, I was a little puzzled that they weren’t showing any emotions,” an officer wrote in the report, according to the newspaper. “Mr. Whited appeared to be calm and collected and Ms. Whited had been standing in the doorway, emotionless.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">A neighbour told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that paramedics carried the baby, who “looked lifeless,” from the house and rushed her to a nearby hospital.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">There, doctors determined that her brain no longer functioned, but for months they were unable to remove her from life support because her father wouldn’t consent.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“The doctors [have] made several attempts by conference calls to the father in jail to explain this baby will never live a normal life,” Susan Ronnie Ogle, a family friend, wrote on a GoFundMe page for the child. “She will never walk, talk, or play. She has no quality of life.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\"><img class=\"PrintableImg\" src=\"http://media.zuza.com/e/d/edd15219-82fa-4798-a0f1-dddad1db8b47/B822650727Z.1_20160810090856_000_GHG1NFHAK.2_Gallery.jpg\" alt=\"Accused\"></p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“Please continue to pray for this sweet baby girl and her family,” she added. “The decisions they face are unbearable.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that once his daughter died, Justin Whited could be charged with her murder. He ultimately agreed to allow her to be removed from life support.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Carson-Barrett, Dinah’s grandmother, wrote on Facebook in June that the infant’s family had all but lost her.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“We love Dinah Paige and will miss her everyday but under the circumstances we have been missing her for a long time already,” she wrote. “Please know how grateful and blessed we are for each and everyone of you.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">On Monday afternoon, Justin and Jamie Whited were transported from jail to the hospital in Atlanta where, a juvenile court judge had ordered, the infant would be removed from life support and allowed to die.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Shortly after 3 p.m., according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she took her last breath.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“Dinah went to be in the arms of our Lord yesterday at 3:31,” someone posted on her paternal grandparents’ Facebook page. “They took her off life support at 12, and she was a fighter, she hung on for a while. But we now know that Dinah is healed and happy and with our father. Our hearts are burdened and broken, but knowing where she’s at gives us peace.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“Please continue to pray for our family, but we still have a long road ahead of us with other issues surrounding Dinah.”</p> </div>",

        "content": "<div> <p class=\"printable-text\">Donald Trump has spawned a new industry, what might be called Trumpology – the study of his mental state and personality. Numerous pundits have suggested that the Republican presidential nominee has some kind of mental illness or medical condition that explains his boastfulness, intemperate outbursts and thin-skinned response to criticism. A recurring theme among these commentators is that Trump displays textbook signs of what psychiatrists call “narcissistic personality disorder.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Not that Hillary Clinton has been spared the long-distance psychiatric evaluations. A recurring meme on conservative blogs is that she suffered brain damage during a fall several years ago. Trump himself mocked his Democratic opponent on Saturday for her comment that she had “short-circuited” when discussing the FBI investigation of her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Trump pointed to his head and said, referring to Clinton, “The people of this country don’t want somebody who is going to short-circuit up here.” He later added, “She is a totally unhinged person. She’s unbalanced. And all you have to do is watch her, see her, read her.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">But psychiatric kibitzing is a slippery business. Largely lost in the conversation about Trump is the fact that a personality disorder is not a mental illness, strictly speaking. A candidate could be a narcissist, but that wouldn’t make him “crazy,” as most people understand the word.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">And though Trump’s critics say he provides a steady stream of evidence that he’s obsessed with his popularity, craves affirmation and has many other attributes of a narcissist, “narcissistic personality disorder” is such an ambiguous condition that the American Psychiatric Association nearly eradicated it six years ago from its official diagnostic manual.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">That happened as the APA was revising the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which included 10 personality disorders. An expert working group wanted to get rid of five of them, including narcissistic personality disorder.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">The ensuing debate exposed a basic truth about the entire category: Personality disorders are not mental illnesses in the way that depression and schizophrenia are, for example. Mental illnesses are conditions of the mind, fundamentally disrupting a person’s inner thoughts and feelings, and usually have a biological origin. Brain scans can discern physical changes often associated with mental illnesses. Medication can treat them in many cases.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">By contrast, personality disorders are not amenable to drug therapy. Nor have neuroscientists found any obvious biological underpinning or any gene associated with them. There also are no physical tests for a diagnosis.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Clinical psychologists and psychiatrists had long used a checklist approach. The fourth edition of the diagnostic manual listed nine common traits for narcissistic personality disorder, including “a grandiose sense of self-importance” and “requires excessive admiration” and “lacks empathy.” Generally, a person demonstrating at least five of those traits could be diagnosed with the disorder.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">In 2010, some experts felt that too many of those markers overlapped with the traits seen in other personality disorders. Another objection: There were just so many narcissists in American society that labeling the condition as a disorder made no sense, they said.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Other psychiatrists pushed back, however, and the plan to drop narcissistic personality disorder was abandoned. In fact, all 10 disorders remained when the DSM-5 was published in 2013 – including paranoid, borderline and dependent personality disorders.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">All human beings have personality traits. A personality disorder reflects long-standing patterns of behavior that developed early in life and differ significantly from the societal norm. There is no specific point at which self-absorption and grandiosity become pathological.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Long-distance psychiatry is necessarily fraught, and the leaders of the profession frown on it. In 1973, the APA adopted the “Goldwater Rule,” which referred to a 1964 controversy in which many psychiatrists participated in a survey asking whether presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was mentally fit to be president. In a blog post last week titled “The Goldwater Rule: Why Breaking it is Unethical and Irresponsible,” APA President Maria A. Oquendo reiterated that psychiatrists shouldn’t offer opinions about candidates they have not personally examined.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">The rule states, in full:</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Part of the difficulty of diagnosing personality disorders comes because so many people, at one time or another during their lives, exhibit some of the characteristics. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which controls executive function, can shrink with age, and an elderly person can experience personality changes that resemble a personality disorder, including a tendency to be a know-it-all or reflexively negative.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Personality disorders are difficult to treat. Narcissists, for example, don’t generally show up at a psychiatrist’s office complaining of arrogant self-centeredness and an inability to accept the idea that they might be wrong about something. When they do seek help, it’s because their personality disorder makes them more susceptible to issues like depression and anxiety.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Peter Freed, a psychiatrist at Columbia University and the Personality Studies Institute in New York City, says he treats a lot of “covert narcissists.” They come in for “rage, depression, bad relationships,” and it typically takes many years before they realize that their core problem is narcissism.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“People are in treatment with me for eight to 10 years. It’s like learning a religion – a religion of one, letting go of an omnipotent god of one,” Freed said.</p> </div>",

After David decided to go to the Belarus capital city Minsk for his career, Phoebe married Mike (<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/paul-rudd/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Rudd</a>) â a fine choice â but it was still a sad end for the science-loving, glasses-wearing character.Well, perhaps it comes as even more tragic news that it wasnât even supposed to be that way.In a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hank-azaria-emmys_us_579a7918e4b08a8e8b5d553a?ec4unv74q5v4r0ms4i&amp;ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618\" target=\"_blank\">recent interview</a> with Azaria about his Emmy nomination for a role in âRay Donovan,âÂ The Huffington Post asked the actor what the Minsk happened. And apparently … <h4>David and Phoebe <em>were</em> supposed to end up together, but Paul Rudd was too charming to write out.</h4> <p><span class=\"storyimage fullwidth inlineimage\"> <span class=\"image\"> <img class=\" loaded\" src=\"http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBvcuMG.img?h=407&amp;w=624&amp;m=6&amp;q=60&amp;o=f&amp;l=f&amp;x=1059&amp;y=558\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\"></span> <span class=\"caption truncate\"> <span class=\"attribution\">Â© Provided by The Huffington Post</span> </span> </span>Responding to whether he knew it would be the end of Davidâs arc when he went to Minsk, Azaria told HuffPost, âNo, I didnât know that was the end of David. The plan always was kind of to bring him back.â</p> <p>David does return in a small capacity on the show, but Azaria specifically meant that he was under the impression Phoebe and David would end up together.</p> <p>âI think, honestly, what happened was Paul Rudd is so awesome that they sort of found a groove with him and [my character] became more of just the grist for that mill,â said Azaria, who added, âAs opposed to the other way around.â</p> <p>Was the actor as upset as his character to lose out to Paul Rudd?</p> <p>âIt actually did sting a little bit,â said Azaria. âWhatever part of me is David the science guy who went to Minsk, which admittedly is probably a small part of me [<em>laughs</em>],Â but that part of me wanted to end up with Phoebe. So I was sort of sad when I didnât.â</p> <div class=\"xnetvidplayer\"></div> </section></article>\n</div> </div>",

Iâve walked and cycled this area for decades and know my neighbourhood very well. I know where the short cuts are, where to pick raspberries, and that the man in the hat on the mural of Tivoliâs exterior wall is based on a real person.</p> <p>Iâve been witness to the changes Kitchissippi has undergone in the last 20 years, ever since Mountain Equipment Co-Op moved in. Soon after that, store owners started complaining about increased rents. Today, many of those independently run businesses are gone.</p> <p>Then the steel-and-glass houses arrived, often with two houses replacing a single home. The new houses are not unattractive, but they bear no resemblance to our red-brick past. I thought the city was supposed to ensure that new developments kept in character with the neighbourhood, but nowhere in Ottawa has this been more ignored than in Kitchissippi. Instead, the city hides behind the theory of intensification.</p> <div id=\"fsk_splitbox_1715\" class=\" fsk_splitbox_1715\"></div> <p>Intensification makes more efficient use of infrastructure, land and other services, if done right. In transit-rich Kitchissippi, intensification was supposed to encourage people to drive less. Unfortunately, some homeownersÂ âÂ with two, three or even four vehiclesÂ âÂ didnât get that memo.</p> <p>Kitchissippi is a desirable neighbourhood. Itâs close to downtown, the river, itâs walkable and cyclable; there are schools, stores and services, parks and mature trees. Itâs always been that way. Even 40Â years ago, Kitchissippi had everything you needed on a daily or weekly basis.</p> <p>What has changed is that a relatively affordable neighbourhood is now the playground for profit-at-any-cost, unimaginative developers, and the reasons that people moved here in the first place are being stripped away.</p> <p>Some of these new homes may soon have flooding issues. When green space is paved over to build homes right to the property line, eventually the landâs ability to absorb water from increasingly extreme storms will be compromised. Water has to go somewhere and many of Ottawaâs storm sewers are not up to the task.</p> <p>Kitchissippiâs neighbourhoods have always been prosperous, but the most expensive properties were traditionally surrounded by lower and middle-class homes and apartments. If you couldnât afford a house on Island Park, you could afford a house nearby and enjoy all the same community benefits as your wealthier neighbours.</p> <p>My house cost less than $150,000 in 1993; itâs now worth three times that. People tell me I should be grateful for the equity, but equity only counts when youâre selling; if you donât plan on moving, equity only means higher property taxes. So why exactly should I fall on my knees in gratitude when my taxes have risen more than 50 per cent in the last 15 years but my services have stayed the same or even been reduced?</p> <p>One would think that the city would want people to stay in one place. Isnât that what makes a community? A community is not a grocery store, or 6,000 new condo units, or even a bigger, better transit system. A community is its people. And communities will always need bitter old bastards like me to make sure that history isnât lost beneath coffee grounds, discarded yoga mats or last yearâs fleece fashions.</p> <p><em><strong>Sharon Boddy</strong> is a freelance editor and writer.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>\n</div>",

Iâve walked and cycled this area for decades and know my neighbourhood very well. I know where the short cuts are, where to pick raspberries, and that the man in the hat on the mural of Tivoliâs exterior wall is based on a real person.</p> <p>Iâve been witness to the changes Kitchissippi has undergone in the last 20 years, ever since Mountain Equipment Co-Op moved in. Soon after that, store owners started complaining about increased rents. Today, many of those independently run businesses are gone.</p> <p>Then the steel-and-glass houses arrived, often with two houses replacing a single home. The new houses are not unattractive, but they bear no resemblance to our red-brick past. I thought the city was supposed to ensure that new developments kept in character with the neighbourhood, but nowhere in Ottawa has this been more ignored than in Kitchissippi. Instead, the city hides behind the theory of intensification.</p> <div id=\"fsk_splitbox_1715\" class=\" fsk_splitbox_1715\"></div> <p>Intensification makes more efficient use of infrastructure, land and other services, if done right. In transit-rich Kitchissippi, intensification was supposed to encourage people to drive less. Unfortunately, some homeownersÂ âÂ with two, three or even four vehiclesÂ âÂ didnât get that memo.</p> <p>Kitchissippi is a desirable neighbourhood. Itâs close to downtown, the river, itâs walkable and cyclable; there are schools, stores and services, parks and mature trees. Itâs always been that way. Even 40Â years ago, Kitchissippi had everything you needed on a daily or weekly basis.</p> <p>What has changed is that a relatively affordable neighbourhood is now the playground for profit-at-any-cost, unimaginative developers, and the reasons that people moved here in the first place are being stripped away.</p> <p>Some of these new homes may soon have flooding issues. When green space is paved over to build homes right to the property line, eventually the landâs ability to absorb water from increasingly extreme storms will be compromised. Water has to go somewhere and many of Ottawaâs storm sewers are not up to the task.</p> <p>Kitchissippiâs neighbourhoods have always been prosperous, but the most expensive properties were traditionally surrounded by lower and middle-class homes and apartments. If you couldnât afford a house on Island Park, you could afford a house nearby and enjoy all the same community benefits as your wealthier neighbours.</p> <p>My house cost less than $150,000 in 1993; itâs now worth three times that. People tell me I should be grateful for the equity, but equity only counts when youâre selling; if you donât plan on moving, equity only means higher property taxes. So why exactly should I fall on my knees in gratitude when my taxes have risen more than 50 per cent in the last 15 years but my services have stayed the same or even been reduced?</p> <p>One would think that the city would want people to stay in one place. Isnât that what makes a community? A community is not a grocery store, or 6,000 new condo units, or even a bigger, better transit system. A community is its people. And communities will always need bitter old bastards like me to make sure that history isnât lost beneath coffee grounds, discarded yoga mats or last yearâs fleece fashions.</p> <p><em><strong>Sharon Boddy</strong> is a freelance editor and writer.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>\n</div>",

Suddenly, four shots whizzed by.</p> <p>The group was playing Pokemon Go and the woman on the rooftop, armed with a pellet gun, was allegedly aiming at them.</p> <p>Police in Newmarket, Ont. say Patricia Champagne, 29, climbed onto the roof of her two-storey apartment building late Saturday, and fired at least four pellets down onto the road.</p> <p>Champagne did not tell<a href=\"http://ottawacitizen.wpdev5.canada.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/07/AzureBentley1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-134462\" src=\"http://ottawacitizen.wpdev5.canada.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/07/AzureBentley1.jpg\" alt=\"AzureBentley1\" width=\"1529\" height=\"817\"></a> officers why she did this, Const. Andy Pattenden of York Regional Police (YPR) said Monday. But even if Pokemon Go, an augmented-reality mobile game released this month, did not provoke her actions, it appears to have played a part.</p> <p>âThereâs a couple of areas in York Region where weâve seen a significant increase in the number of people out on the streets and gathering in certain areas, playing this game,â Pattenden said.</p> <p>That includes Main Street South in Newmarket, a cluster of stores, restaurants and residential buildings, where bystanders told police they were playing Pokemon Go Saturday night. At about 10:30 p.m., officers responded to reports of a woman âshooting a handgun-style pellet gunâ from a nearby roof, according to a YRP release.</p> <p>None of the shots connected, and no one was injured. Officers entered the apartment complex, arrested Champagne and confiscated the pellet gun.</p> <p>âIâm gathering that there were probably quite a few people in the area at the time,â Pattenden said, adding he didnât know how close any of the pellets came to striking anyone.</p> <p>Police charged Champagne with assault with a weapon and possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose. She was released from custody and is scheduled to appear in court Aug. 26.</p> <p>Pattenden said York police have received a âsignificantâ number of calls â likely in the dozens â this month from residents concerned about large, impromptu gatherings of people. Many have turned out to be PokÃ©mon Go players. Pattenden said no one has been charged for playing the game.</p> <p>âTo date, everythingâs been done in a lawful manner,â he said. âWe havenât received reports of people trespassing or causing any issues.â</p> <p><img id=\"storyphoto\" class=\"wp-post-image\" title=\"Pokemon Go players gather at a park in Los Angeles.

May be passed as an array to allow for alternative plurals when using this argument as a base to construct the capabilities, e.g. array(‘story’, ‘stories’) the first array element will be used for the singular capabilities and the second array element for the plural capabilities, this is instead of the auto generated version if no array is given which would be “storys”. The ‘capability_type’ parameter is used as a base to construct capabilities unless they are explicitly set with the ‘capabilities’ parameter.

        "content": "<div> <p>Wine consumption figures are published every now and again, giving usÂ per capita figures for each country and trends over time. Are weÂ drinking more or less wine, and how does our consumption compare that ofÂ other countries?</p> <p>Itâs clear that Canadians drink far more wine these days than 10 or 20Â years ago. Wine has become part of lifestyle for many people, and theÂ scores of web sites, books, blogs, newspaper columns, and apps reflectÂ wide interest. Canadians now drink 15 litres of wine a head each year.Â Thatâs 20 bottles a year â about a bottle and a half a month â and itâsÂ twice what we were drinking in 1990.</p> <p>Americans drink less, 11 litres, but citizens of some countries drinkÂ much more. The French down 43 litres a year, the Italians 36 litres, andÂ Germans 25 litres. Coming up quickly are Australians and New Zealanders,Â with 21 litres each. Some (like Canada) are increasing, but big consumers such as the French, Italians, and Spanish, having beenÂ drinking steadily less wine since the 1960s.</p> <p>The worldâs biggest wine-drinkers? The people who live in the VaticanÂ City top the table, with 50 litres each per year (just over a bottle aÂ week). And people on small, isolated islands seem to find solace in wineÂ bottles: St Helena, in the south Atlantic, and Norfolk Island, between Australia and New Zealand, are in the top five.</p> <p>The problem with per capita figures is that they include everyone:Â children, women and men. If you took out people under 15, youâd have aÂ higher rate of wine consumption. And within the adult population, someÂ groups drink more than others. Men drink more than women, poorer peopleÂ drink less wine than the better-off, and older people drink more thanÂ younger people.</p> <p>This accounts to some extent for all the wine consumed in the VaticanÂ City. They are nearly all adults, with a majority of men. Iâm surprisedÂ their wine consumption isnât higher. A bottle of wine a week isnât evenÂ a small glass a day.</p> <p>In fact, âper capita consumptionâ is misleading: itâs really the amountÂ of wine available to everyone. Consumption is much more restricted. ForÂ one thing, many adults never drink: about a third of Americans and aÂ fifth of Italians and Canadians. Obviously, the more non-drinkers thereÂ are, the more wine is available to a smaller group of adults.</p> <p>How does your wine consumption fit into the picture? If you drink aÂ bottle a week, youâre up there with the citizens of the Vatican. If youÂ drink two bottles a week â a glass or two a day â youâre well up thereÂ and might find retiring to a remote island very congenial.</p> <figure class=\"wp-caption post-img size_this_image_test aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_627462\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-627462\" src=\"http://wpmedia.ottawacitizen.com/2015/09/left-to-right-goats-do-roam-villa-maria-pinot-noir-guard.jpeg?quality=55&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Goats do Roam, Villa Maria Pinot Noir, Guardian Red Blend, Ring Bolt Cabernet Sauvignon\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text wp-caption\"><span class=\"img-caption\"> Goats Do Roam Red, Villa Maria Pinot Noir, Guardian Reserve Blend, Ringbolt Cabernet Sauvignon</span> <span class=\"img-author\"> Wayne Cuddington / Ottawa Citizen</span> </figcaption></figure><h3>Goats do Roam Red 2014</h3> <p>From South Africaâs Western Cape region, this dry, shiraz-dominant blendÂ delivers concentrated and nicely layered flavours right through, cleanÂ and fresh acidity, and light tannins.

        "content": "<div> <p>Iâve made this recipe several times and Iâve loved it more each time. The crumb coating gets crispy and rich, but with bright notes of lemon zest and Dijon. Underneath, the salmon remains moist, succulent and meltingly tender.</p> <p>Itâs dead-easy to make and, if youâre making it for guests, you can even make the crumb coating in advance, refrigerate it covered in bowl, thenÂ sprinkle it on to the mustard-coated fish just before cooking.</p> <p>The recipe is a slightly adapted version of one from Ina Garten. It works well with roasted baby potatoes (roll them in a little olive oil and salt and pepper); just preheat the oven to 425 F (220 C)Â aboutÂ 45 minutes before you want to eat and start the potatoes before the salmon. It also makes a great Easter entrÃ©e, with roast asparagus topped with a vinaigrette.</p> <p><strong>Panko-Crusted Salmon</strong></p> <p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4 servings</p> <p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> about 25Â minutes</p> <p>2/3 cup (160 mL) panko (Japanese dried bread crumbs)</p> <p>2 tbsp (30 mL) minced fresh parsley</p> <p>1 tsp (5 mL) grated lemon zest</p> <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p> <p>3 tbsp (45 mL) melted butter, divided</p> <p>1Â½Â to 2 lb (680 to 900 g) piece salmon fillet, skin on</p> <p>1Â½Â tbsp (22.5 mL) Dijon mustard</p> <p>2 tbsp (20 mL) vegetable oil</p> <p>Lemon wedges for serving</p> <ol>\n<li>Preheat oven to 425 F (220 C).</li> <li>In a small bowl, mix together the panko crumbs, parsley, lemon zest,Â Â½ tsp (2.5 mL) salt andÂ Â½ tsp (2.5 mL) pepper. Melt 3 tbsp (45 mL)Â butter in a glass measuring cup in microwave; drizzle about half the melted butter over the crumbs, stirring until crumbs are evenly coated. Set aside crumbs and remaining melted butter.</li> <li>Place the salmon fillet, skin side down, on a board. Spread the top with mustard and then sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Press the panko mixture thickly on top of the mustard. The mustard will help the panko adhere.</li> <li>Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a 12-inch (30-cm) cast-iron skillet or other large, heavy, ovenproof pan. When the oil is very hot, add the salmon, skin side down, and sear for 3 to 4 minutes, without turning, until the skin is brown and crisp.</li> <li>Transfer the pan to the hot oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until the salmon is almost cooked. Drizzle the remaining butter over the top of the crumbs and broil for just a few minutes, until some of the crumbs are browned and crispy. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve the salmon with lemon wedges.</li> </ol>\n</div>",

(Provided by Katy Creates)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to B+H senior associate StÃ©phane Raymond, the Rideau Centre revitalization was allÂ about opening the dark and dreary walkways and shops within the mall to the Ottawa skyline and allowing more natural light to flood in.</p> <p>âThe Centre was first opened in 1983, and I think that was the late end of a certain style,â said Raymond, referring to the mallâs dark, artificially lit hallways.Â He said opening the exterior of the mall, which runs parallel toÂ Rideau Street, was difficult because retailers had to buy into the concept of bringing in natural light.</p> <div id=\"fsk_splitbox_1715\" class=\" fsk_splitbox_1715\"></div> <p>â<span class=\"s1\">Itâs challenging, because a lot of retailers prefer wall space to windows,â he said. â</span>Weâve renovated all of their existing facades, which you probably remember as being mostly pre-cast with not many windows out to the street. Thatâs all been replaced with a lot of glass. Itâs very open.â</p> <figure class=\"wp-caption post-img size_this_image_test aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_857834\"><img class=\"wp-image-857834 size-full\" src=\"http://wpmedia.ottawacitizen.com/2016/08/rideau-centre-photos-provided-by-publicist-katy-creates-from6.jpeg?quality=55&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Rideau Centre photos provided by publicist Katy Creates from KG&amp;A for Vito's story on the architect. 0805 rideau Katy Creates Publicist katy@kimgraham.ca T. 416.537.0954 ext. 2320 M: 416.831.8129\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text wp-caption\"><span class=\"img-caption\"> A design concept of the new Simons store at the Rideau Centre.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Raymond said the retailers have now embraced the idea, with many using the large windows to entice consumers to come inside. Some, such as Montreal clothier Simons, which is opening in the expansion, have even set up sitting areas and cafÃ©s which allow customers to sit and admire the view.</p> <p>The redesign, according to Raymond, is also aimed at tyingÂ in the new Rideau Centre with work soon to be completed on Rideau Street, which was closed last year to mostÂ passenger vehicle traffic and some buses as crews beganÂ revitalizing the street, creating a public park at Ogilvy Square and finishing the Rideau Street transit station, which will deliver passengers on the LRTâs new underground Confederation Line when it opens in 2018.</p> <p>The Bay, meanwhile, is undergoing its own renovation.</p> <p>The area is bordered by the ByWard Market and the University of Ottawa. Raymond said the plan was to create a propertyÂ that allows for flow through the area and encourages patrons to walk, rest or shop at their leisure.</p> <figure class=\"wp-caption post-img size_this_image_test aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_857831\"><img class=\"wp-image-857831 size-full\" src=\"http://wpmedia.ottawacitizen.com/2016/08/rideau-centre-photos-provided-by-publicist-katy-creates-from3.jpeg?quality=55&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Rideau Centre photos provided by publicist Katy Creates from KG&amp;A for Vito's story on the architect. 0805 rideau Katy Creates Publicist katy@kimgraham.ca T. 416.537.0954 ext. 2320 M: 416.831.8129\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text wp-caption\"><span class=\"img-caption\"> The new Rideau Centre set to open Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wednesdayâs opening offers a glimpse atÂ the future of Rideau Street,Â which has seen billions of dollars in investment over the past decade and is fuelling hopes of a retail revival in the heart of the city.</p> <p>ReconstructionÂ of the Rideau Centre involved the removal of several familiar tenants, the relocation of the food court, and theÂ addition of a fewÂ new retailers, with many opening their first shops in the nationâs capital.</p> <p>The aged cinema that once spanned the Rideau Centreâs fourth floor has been pulled down to accommodateÂ theÂ Simons store. The popular MarchÃ© restaurant vanished from its long-held space beneath the escalators on the mallâs first floor. Cinnabon is but a sweet memory, and the Sports Experts store near Rideau Street is closing its doors.</p> <p>The souped-up food court was moved about a year ago to a larger space filled with higher-end food offerings. In its old spot is a sleek, relocated Shoppers Drug Mart. Nordstrom now occupies the space once held byÂ Sears, and clothing retailer H&amp;M is opening its second Ottawa location at the mall.</p> <p>There will also be four new restaurants and 386 more parking spots.</p> <p>When the Rideau Centre broke ground inÂ 2013 on theÂ $360-million expansion and renovation, the plan includedÂ 230,000 square feet of new spaceÂ in theÂ four-storey shopping area on the site of the dilapidatedÂ Ogilvy Building, which hadÂ stood empty for 20 years prior its demolition.</p> </div>",

        "content": "<div> <p class=\"printable-text\">It was already clear nearly a year ago, from the floor of Baltimore Comic-Con, that this month’s “Suicide Squad” would be a hit. There in Charm City, as cosplayers flocked to the Inner Harbor, a costumed Harley Quinn couldn’t swing her supersize mallet over her head without hitting, well, another Harley Quinn.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Some of the young women were in traditional full-jester Harley garb. Others were in Popsicle-colored pigtails and ripped tee, rocking the full Margot Robbie. They outnumbered the usual Black Widows and Bat-characters and Wonder Woman look-alikes, and served as a telling bellwether.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Among fans, the page-to-screen Harley â as the Joker’s favourite hot mess â had already reached a critical mass.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Which is why all the fresh rants about “Do movie critics matters?” miss the more telling question about Warner Bros./DC’s “Suicide Squad,” which, in the wake of mostly poor reviews, still opened over the weekend to $135.1 million domestically and $268.4 million worldwide.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">No, the more germane query is: How massively did Harley Quinn just rescue the entire “Suicide Squad” production?</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Now, there is no guarantee that “Suicide Squad” will have box-office legs, let alone hit the magic billion-dollar mark â the film could see a precipitous second-weekend drop approaching an eye-popping 70 per cent, as WB/DC’s first superhero-world film this year, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” did. But if the film can even earn anything like “BvS’s” $872.7 million worldwide, it will safely lead to Harley’s next projects.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Plus, “Suicide Squad,” to be sure, is flawed â it certainly would have helped if David Ayer and Co. had had more than a reported two months to turn around a sturdy script. Among fellow diehard comics fans I know, some would love to get a crack at improving that screenplay.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Thankfully, Oscar-nominated actors such as Viola Davis (as Amanda Waller) and Will Smith (Deadshot) deliver strong performances in oft-workmanlike roles. Yet relatively few fans will be cosplaying as them at this year’s Balto Con.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Thanks greatly to Harley Quinn’s inclusion, nearly half of this past weekend’s audience for “Suicide Squad” trends female â a high percentage for a superhero-world film. I’ve asked some female relatives and friends who are fierce feminists (including a mental-health therapist â the same kind of work that Harley does): What is it about onscreen Harley Quinn that is appealing?</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">They acknowledge that her ever-shorter costumes can be viewed as standard Hollywood-issue sexism and cheap appeal to the young male moviegoer demo. Some point out that the film, unlike the comics and the animated series, glosses over the extreme nature of the Joker’s physical abuse (including defenestration).</p> <p class=\"printable-text\"><img class=\"PrintableImg\" src=\"http://media.zuza.com/f/9/f99217ce-c2dd-444d-9caa-740e894e43db/B822650669Z.1_20160810073355_000_GHG1NFGQ9.2_Gallery.jpg\" alt=\"SUICIDE SQUAD\"></p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Yet the same refrain keeps popping up: “We just like her.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Harley Quinn is written to be flawed, and on screen, the writing of her is flawed. But Harley is the new film’s safety net, even if so much else doesn’t quite land safely. Some other elements of “Suicide Squad” might be a hot mess, but Robbie’s Harley â not unlike Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti’s scripting of Harley in the current DC comic books â never ceases to command centre stage.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">She is playful amid her profound wounds. She seeks to reclaim power amid abuse. She is actually textured and complex beneath the cotton-candy exterior and “You Don’t Own Me” tune.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">On the page and on the screen, Harley Quinn never ceases to compel.

The other two people were treated for facial injuries.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">At least two people who rode in the last year on “Verruckt” â German for “insane” â say nylon shoulder straps came loose during the raft ride.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">It’s unclear whether the straps played any role in Caleb’s death. Police and Schlitterbahn have not provided any other details of Caleb’s death.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">A spokesperson for the water-park on Wednesday declined to discuss the circumstances of the boy’s death.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">The park said Tuesday that the ride would be closed for the remainder of the season.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">On the 2-year-old waterslide certified by Guinness World Records as the world’s tallest, riders sit in multi-person rafts that begin with the steep drop, followed by a surge up a second hill before a 50-foot descent to a finishing pool. Along the way, riders clutch ropes along the inside of the raft.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Riders are harnessed in with two nylon seatbelt-like straps â one that crosses the rider’s lap, the other stretching diagonally like a car shoulder seatbelt. Each strap is held in place by long Velcro-style straps, not by buckles.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Ken Martin, a Richmond, Virginia-based amusement park safety consultant, questioned whether the straps were appropriate for what he called “nothing more than a roller-coaster with water.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">In early tests, rafts carrying sandbags flew off the slide, prompting engineers to tear down half of the ride and reconfigure some angles. A promotional video about building the slide includes footage of two men riding a raft down a half-size test model and going slightly airborne as it crests the top of the first big hill.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“I think they designed this ride, and they figured since stuff was flying out, we better do something to keep people from flying out,” he said. “I think we have a serious issue with the restraint system. Period.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Although he has not seen or ridden Verruckt, Martin said a more solid restraint system that fits over the body â similar to those used in roller-coasters â may have been better.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Jon Rust, a professor of textile engineering at North Carolina State University, said the material used on the straps, commonly called hook and loop, isn’t designed to keep a person in the seat. It also can get old and degrade with use.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">“It’s got to be used in a safe manner, and that doesn’t include stopping someone’s fall or preventing someone’s ejection,” Rust said.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Paul Oberhauser told local television station KCTV that his shoulder restraint “busted loose” on his Verruckt raft July 26. The Nebraska man said he “just held on,” and a video shot by his wife shows the strap loose at the ride’s end. Oberhauser said he reported the matter to park workers.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Kenneth Conrad told WDAF-TV that during his trip down the waterslide last year with a friend, the friend’s shoulder strap came “completely off.” Conrad’s wife snapped a photo at the end of the ride showing the strap missing, and Conrad didn’t file a complaint with the park.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">The park’s spokesperson said in a statement that “a limited portion” of the park would reopen Wednesday.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Each rider on the Verruckt must be at least 54 inches tall, and the group’s weight is limited to a total of 400 to 550 pounds. Caleb was seated with two women unrelated to him and who sustained minor facial injuries.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Police were investigating the death as a criminal case although police spokesperson Cameron Morgan said Tuesday that designation did not mean they suspect foul play.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Caleb’s parents â Republican state Rep. Scott Schwab and his wife, Michele â have requested privacy and have not spoken publicly since the death of Caleb, whose funeral is Friday.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Verruckt’s 2014 opening repeatedly was delayed, though the operators didn’t explain why. Two media sneak preview days in 2014 were cancelled because of problems with a conveyor system that hauls 100-pound rafts to the top of the slide.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Kansas statutes governing amusement rides don’t specifically mention waterslides. State law leaves it to the Kansas Department of Labor to adopt rules and regulations relating to certification and inspection of rides, adding that a permanent amusement ride must be scrutinized at least once a year by “a qualified Insp.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Regulations require only that owners of permanent amusement rides retain records for a year and rides are randomly selected quarterly for a records audit.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">Documents released Tuesday by the state department showed that in June 2012, a records audit found that the park was not maintaining records of testing for current and previous years. The report said that instead of such testing, “visual inspections are conducted annually and daily.” There was no record of a state response, and the audit was marked “pass.”</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">There were no indications of further records audits, and department officials did not immediately answer questions about why that was so.</p> <p class=\"printable-text\">The state requested documentation from Schlitterbahn “to ensure all safety requirements have been followed.” Department officials didn’t immediately provide additional details.</p> </div>",
